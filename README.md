# Pedoer

A standalone React Native Pedometer App based on Googla Android APi, currenly support Android platform only.

run `npm install https://github.com/aboveyunhai/Pedoer.git`, <br>
then execute `react-native run android`

### Motivation:
There are already tons of well-built fitness apps around, but I'm the particular oddity who has no interest in those fitness communities, notifications, etc. <br>
Those also created many unnecessary bundles and huge battery comsumption<br>
So I just want to create a **pure** pedometer app for myself and my family. Silently run in the background with minial battery usage.<br>

Do some **NON-SENSE** react-native UI/UX experiments for data presentation, battery comsumption check and possible RN optimization

I currently use it to debug and help improve https://github.com/StasDoskalenko/react-native-google-fit. The core functionaty of this app.

### Todo:

* possibly fully expand the app to full fitness data,
* some code struction optimaziation
